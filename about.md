# Monet Photos
Monet Photos allows you to transcribe the everyday photos you take into pieces of art. It does so by transfering Monet's painting style onto the pictures you take, using your smartphone. Get ready to see the sunset, yourself and every frame you capture in the eyes of a famous french painter.
